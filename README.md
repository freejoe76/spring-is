### How to set up a dev environment
This is a python 3 app, make sure you have python 3 installed before continuing. `brew install python3` on a mac.

1. To create a virtual environment using python3, run something like `mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/local/bin/python3 SPRING`.
1. cd to the project root
1. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you don't have python 3 and virtualenv set up:

1. `brew install python3`
1. `pip3 install virtualenv`
1. `pip3 install virtualenvwrapper`
1. `VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python3`
1. `source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh`
